=ImageBundle

ImageBundleHelper adds view helper +image_bundle+. A helper which
bundles individual local images into a single CSS sprite thereby
reducing the number of HTTP requests needed to render the page.

{Yahoo's Exceptional Performance
team}[http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/] found that the number
of HTTP requests has the biggest impact on page rendering speed. You
can inspect your site's performance with the excellent Firefox add-on
